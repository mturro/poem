i wrote a poem--damn i need to piss--i wrote a poem that i worked and
bended and wrought into something--damn i need to piss--something that
was supposed to be a thing that might get me--damn i need to
piss--that might get me somewhere on the map of this thing we call
insight (influence?)--damn i need to piss--this thing of modern or
post-modern or post-authentic or post-postal work that never seems to
get anywhere that we all haven't been before--damn i need to
piss--streaming itself from the gut like a flow of sugary water from an
easy open poorly labeled can--damn i need to piss--where all the
ingredients mock and defy and flaunt improbable arrays of
consonants-----damn i need to piss-----letters conspiring to hide the
plain reality where chemically effcient profit masqurades as
nutritionally balanced scientific advancement for a dry and starving
planet.  

**i'm going to go piss now.**
