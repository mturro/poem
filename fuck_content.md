fuck content. seriously, just fuck the whole idea.  
superficial  
inconsequential  
artificial    
content to be managed and distributed and sold.  
  
just stop.    
  
stop marketing at me.   
stop design thinking.  
stop disrupting the trivial.  
stop connecting graphs.  
stop talking about monetizing.  
stop telling everyone how big your data is.
