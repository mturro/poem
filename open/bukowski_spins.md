## Bukowski spins  
"Food to share."    
A warm and inviting sentiment    
painted white across a green wooden   
box, weathered by time and and chipped by   
soil, reaches out from a feed numbed    
by the callow perhaps offensive notion    
that a poet's words are less than art;  
less than the opening to this or that world;  
less than the sigils and sounds and syllables  
of pain bleeding through alcoholic reality.  

"Bukowski!" they yell.   
Bukowski had a secret and we can use  
it to write better copy to sell more  
useless shit to people who might have  
been better off if we dropped the content  
and dropped the marketing and just spoke  
through virgin words without concern for the dollar.  

"Bukowski!" again.  
You see, it's all about the line.  
So what if his line was something of a switchblade;  
sharp and hidden and lethal to the fat belly of  
low-level, fast-food, high fructose content hacks.  
There is something in his approach that we can use to    
sell this thing that nobody anywhere will ever really need.   

"Food to share."  
Pure healthy green food to share.  
Grown and given for no other reason   
than the rightness of feeding each other.  
At human scale, face to face, food is poetry.     
But here in RSS the poetics of organic  
produce grind against the syndicated feed   
of bitter and lonely sales messages.    
And though we feel informed we still  
starve for the simple truth that only    
the living, breathing, teaming soil can provide.
