## a meditation opens
December 21, 2012 2:19 PM
Something keeps telling me I need to meditate.
Something inside me, some need to 
	defend myself against the 
	rough and mean spirits
	of a hard-lined, hard-hearted
	socio-cultural malaise.
Something keeps telling me I need to meditate. 
Something without me, some lost
	and wandering window of
	time spread out against
	itself like an old master
	a poem of tired retreat.
Something keeps telling me I need to meditate.
