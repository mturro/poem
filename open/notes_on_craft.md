## Notes on craft
```
Super-efficient lollipop machined to   
    the end of bleached white stick,  
Wrapped in and out with an orange and  
    glow that feels outside of natural.

**marginal food**
**almost edible**
**dyspeptic and heartless it dominates through some unknowable magic**

Is it the factory, {the machine}, the automatic  
    wind of mass production that seeps itself  
in a cloud, as a datapoint, as an enumerated  
    step on a list where this happens then that?  

Is it the store, {the product}, the incorporated  
    conglomerate of chemical modification born
for the market in air conditioned focus groups   
    shielded from the heat by shopping malls?  

Somewhere in this process is the thing  
    that makes us all human again.   
Some slow familiar foam bubbles in the  
    gaslit boroughs of the ego branded city.
