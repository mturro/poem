## Notes on craft
This barbaric lollipop against the craft  
	>spills into the other end of the day.  
There is something in the orange and  
	>glow that feels outside of natural.

Is it a factory, a machine, an automated  
	>wind of overworked hair-netted thought?  
Is it a cloud, a datapoint, an enumerated  
	>step on a list where this happens then that?  
Is it a store, a product, an incorporated  
	>conglomerate of chemical modification?  

Somewhere in this process is the thing  
	>that makes us all human again.   
Some slow familiar foam bubbles in the  
	>gaslit boroughs of the ego branded city.
