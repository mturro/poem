## Notes on craft
This barbaric lollipop against the craft  
    spills into the other end of the day.  
There is something in the orange and  
    glow that feels outside of natural.

Is it a factory, a machine, an automated  
    wind of overworked hair-netted thought?  
Is it a cloud, a datapoint, an enumerated  
    step on a list where this happens then that?  
Is it a store, a product, an incorporated  
    conglomerate of chemical modification?  

Somewhere in this process is the thing  
    that makes us all human again.   
Some slow familiar foam bubbles in the  
    gaslit boroughs of the ego branded city.
