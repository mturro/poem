## a long division

I stood before the sliding glass looking 
out and over the manufactured pink  
of a crayon colored number two, past  
the weathered wooden deck and into the   
fenced stillness of a winter-gray morning.  

Color, sleeping since fall, made it's stand    
against the season in the bright yellow     
plastic and chains of a wooden playset      
unused yet swinging in invisible   
wind where the lot stopped and the field began.  

The new year had come and brought with it the    
things that new years bringâ€“new books new money  
new television new recordings of   
new people with new and rambling lists of   
things to do or never to do again.   


(Insert stanza dealing with contentment)


Yet there in the kitchen before breakfast    
with morning spilling through me note by note  
I could feel some forked version of myself  
whose thought though distant still twisted in mine  
like white milk swirling in dark black coffee.   
        
As I was looking forward to the new    
year here was some version of me perhaps    
some shadow of the person I used to  
want to be lingering in a soft-boiled  
fog of memory and thought and dream like    
a fault in time both present and remote.  



SCRAPS----->
The two of us stood there  
looking out through sliding glass  
only just now becoming aware  
of each other.  
We lived two of many worlds  
impossible and unknowable  
and cosmically remote. Yet we were  
THERE(|) together alone with only images  
for communication. Impressions,  
a shared qualia 
so fine    
so particular  
yet not necessarily solitary 
a current along some unidentifiable field. 

The coffee was ready. 
	One drip, one press  
		one dark, one blonde    
			one mug, one cup    
				one milk  
					one sugar.
