## a long division

He stood in front of sliding glass looking out and over the pink  
			of a crayon colored number 2  
				past the weathered wooden deck   
					into a damp winter-gray  
					yard.  

Color, sleeping since fall, made a stand against the season  
			as streaks of yellow swing chains  
				unused and moved only by wind  
					at the back of the  
					yard. 

{The new year had come and it brought with it all the new things that years will bring.}  

There were:  
1. new television shows,  
2. new books,  
3. new recordings,  
4. new people,  
5. new money,
6. new lists,  
things to do / never do again.      
Yes, there were long / rambling    
lists / things that had  
never been that now are. 

Waiting for the coffee and letting the morning  
		spill into him one note  
			at a time,  
				he realized,  
					THERE(|)  
on that spot(â€¢),  
		looking out and over  
			that crayon colored {2}  
that he had let some part of himself oversleep.  
			that crayon colored {2}  
was:  
		more than just a happy reminder 
			of everything that he had===  		
			more than just a simple cut out 
				beginning to 2013===  
				more than a happy new year. 

As he stood THERE(|) looking out and over  
			that crayon colored {2}  
				he was looking forward to be sure.  
				 But there was some critical part of him===  
				 some memory of the person he used to want to be===  
				 that was just now emerging  
				 from the fog of a unfortunately warm  
				 January mist.  

Perhaps (if !=he) stood THERE(|?) in parallel.  
	Perhaps THERE(|?) was a former future version of himself  
		THERE(|?) next to him thinking less technically  
			about the color of the  
				yard.   

It would be / had to be him,   
him as a splinter of time. 

The two of them stood THERE(||)  
looking out through sliding glass  
only just now becoming aware  
of each other.  
They lived two of many worlds  
impossible and unknowable  
and cosmically remote. Yet they were  
THERE(|) together alone with only images  
for communication. Impressions,  
a shared qualia 
so fine    
so particular  
yet not necessarily solitary 
a current along some unidentifiable field. 

The coffee was ready. 
	One drip, one press  
		one dark, one blonde    
			one mug, one cup    
				one milk  
					one sugar.
