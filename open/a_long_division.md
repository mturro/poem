## a long division

I stood in front of sliding glass looking 
out and over the manufactured  
			pink of a crayon colored number two  
				past the weathered wooden deck   
					into a winter-gray  
					yard.  

Color, sleeping since fall, made it's stand  
against the season in the bright  
			yellow streaks of a common wooden playset    
				unused and moved only by wind  
					at the back of the  
					yard. 

The new year had come and it brought with it    
new television shows,new books new  
      recordings of new people with new money,  
        new and rambling lists of things  
          to do or never do  
          again.   

Waiting for the coffee and letting the morning  
		spill into me one note  
			at a time,  
				I realized,  
					THERE(|)  
on that spot(â€¢),  
		looking out and over  
			that crayon colored {2}  
that I had let some part of mymself oversleep.  
			that crayon colored {2}  
was===  
		more than just a happy reminder 
			of everything that I had===  		
			more than just a simple cut out 
				beginning to 2013===  
				more than a happy new year. 

As I stood THERE(|) looking out and over  
			that crayon colored {2}  
				I was looking forward to be sure.  
				 But there was some critical part of me===  
				 some memory of the person I used to want to be===  
				 just now emerging  
				 from the fog of 
				 an unfortunately warm  
				 January mist.  

Perhaps I stood THERE(|?) in parallel.  
	Perhaps THERE(|?) was a former future version of myself  
		THERE(|?) next to me thinking less technically  
			about the color of the  
				yard.   

If it was me at all it was     
not exactly me but me as  
a splinter of time  

The two of us stood THERE(||)  
looking out through sliding glass  
only just now becoming aware  
of each other.  
We lived two of many worlds  
impossible and unknowable  
and cosmically remote. Yet we were  
THERE(|) together alone with only images  
for communication. Impressions,  
a shared qualia 
so fine    
so particular  
yet not necessarily solitary 
a current along some unidentifiable field. 

The coffee was ready. 
	One drip, one press  
		one dark, one blonde    
			one mug, one cup    
				one milk  
					one sugar.
