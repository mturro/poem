## Poems

This repo is a collection of work-in-progress poems written in the markdown syntax. It is an attempt to expose my creative process (to myself and to anyone who may care to watch) and track the nature and number of edits a final version of a given poem will go through. I'm using git (as opposed to some other tool like mediawiki) simply because it makes sense to me and it's a tool I use on a daily basis. I also find it affords a level of textual simplicty that more bloated CMS style tools loose in their effort to be complete publishing tools. 

These poems are simply me writing to myself and are not intended for any other purpose than to exercise my brain. They are licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/deed.en_US).  I understand that this is not a Free Culture license. My decsion to apply restrictions - slight as they may be - to these poems is not because of any lack of faith in the Free Culture movement, but rather because these poems are, by the very nature of their presence in this repo, unfinished versions of some possible future work. Feel free to quote, copy or publish these poems in a non-commercial way, but if you would like to do more with them, or modify them in some way please use submit a request as an issue.
